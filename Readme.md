# Crabby

A pointless cli game made in rust.

## Background

This is just me playing around with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) I wanted to make something simple to understand the language on a basic level. This game is kinda like whack a mole where you are 🦀 [ferris the crab](https://rustacean.net/) and you use the arrow keys to move around and squash the bugs.

## Play Arround

Make sure you have rust installed. The easiest way to do this is with [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Eshanatnight/Crabby.git
```

```powershell
    cd Crabby
```

```powershell
    cargo run
```
